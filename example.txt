If you have a model with lots of layers, you can create a list first and then use the * operator to expand the list into positional arguments, like this:

layers = []
layers.append(nn.Linear(3, 4))
layers.append(nn.Sigmoid())
layers.append(nn.Linear(4, 1))
layers.append(nn.Sigmoid())

net = nn.Sequential(*layers)
This will result in a similar structure of your code, as adding directly.
